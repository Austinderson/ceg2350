### Overview
This is a freshman-level 4 credit hour course conducted in a 14-week semester.
Its goal is to develop in the minds of students an effective operational model
of computer systems running either Linux or Windows. This course is
lab-oriented. 

Catalog Description: Provides introduction to Linux and Windows operating
systems and system administration. Covers files and directories, ownership and
sharing, programs and processes, system calls, libraries, dynamic linking,
command line shells, scripting, regular expressions and secure network
protocols.

2. Pilot.wright.edu

#### Prerequisites
General exposure to PCs, and MS Windows which is so common that we do not list
it as official prerequisites. CEG2350 does not assume prior exposure to
Unix/Linux. Familiarity with a programming language (such as C++, or Java) is
expected. 

### Topics
These will not be covered exactly in the order below, we will skip around as we
combine some of the knowledge from later topics with those covered earlier in
the course.
1. Operating systems basics.  Commands: `man, bash`.
2. Files and directories: files, file systems, permissions, compression,
   encryption, hard and soft links. Commands: `ls, ln, cp, mv, rm, cat, chmod,
   chown, dd. gzip, tar, file, wc, sort, uniq, gpg`.
3. Programs and Processes: system calls, libraries, virtual memory, loading,
   linking. Commands: `/proc, ps, top, nice, bg, fg, ldd`.
4. Command Line Interpreters and scripting.  `bash`
5. Utilities.  Regular expressions, version control.  Commands: `grep, diff,
   make, find, git`.
6. Networking.  Host names, IP addresses, ports, TCP/UDP, DNS.  Commands: `ssh,
   sftp, ping, tracert, nmap, wget, curl`.
7. Programs/Applications.  Compiling, linking, libraries, installing.  
   Commands: `make, apt, ln`
8. Systems administration.  Users, groups, permissions, security.
9. Cloud computing and virtualization.

### Grading
Letter grades: A/90%, B/80%, C/70%, D/60%, F/ Less than 60%

This course is lab-oriented. Expected number of labs: 10, worth 6% each, about
one per week. 

Two exams worth 15% and 25%.

### Attendance
Attendance to both Lecture and Lab sessions is mandatory. 
Attendance will be taken via in class quiz at random.  Each quiz is not graded,
but missing more than 2 without PRIOR approval will result in a 3% reduction in
your final grade for each quiz missed.
