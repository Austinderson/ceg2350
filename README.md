# CEG-2350 Operating System Concepts & Usage
This repository will hold both the lecture notes and the lab instructions for both sections of CEG-2350.  To make a local copy of this repository first make sure git is installed (with `sudo apt install git`), then run the following:

```
git clone https://github.com/mkijowski/ceg2350.git
```

The purpose of this repository is to have one location to keep all lecture notes and labs so that students can work at their own pace for the rest of the semester.
